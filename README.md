##  SQL Server Setup (SSMS)

Use the provided schema in `database.sql` to create the following tables:

- Hotels
- Rooms
- Users
- Reservations
- Bills

And the stored procedures:
- `sp_check_room_availability`
- `sp_login_user`
- `sp_create_reservation`
- `sp_generate_bill`

Also insert some test data to begin with.

```sql
INSERT INTO Hotels VALUES ('Taj Hotel', 'Delhi');
INSERT INTO Rooms VALUES (1, '101', 'Deluxe', 5000, 2, 1);
INSERT INTO Users VALUES ('anjali', 'HASHED_PASS', 'Anjali Aggarwal', 'anjali@email.com');
```

##  Features

- 🔐 User login via stored procedure
- 📅 Check room availability
- ✅ Create reservation
- 💳 Generate bills

---

##  UI Components

Each form is modern and responsive:
- `LoginForm` → login with username/password
- `AvailabilityForm` → checks available rooms by hotel & date
- `ReservationForm` → book a room
- `BillForm` → generate bill for reservation

All styles are maintained with modular CSS for clarity.

---

## ❓Troubleshooting

- `ETIMEOUT` or `ESOCKET` errors → ensure SQL Server is running and reachable at `127.0.0.1:1433`
- Login not working? → Ensure correct user/password hash in DB
- CORS issues? → Check backend `cors()` middleware is enabled
